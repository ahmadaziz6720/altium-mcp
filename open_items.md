# Open Items

What sessions found in this fork's server and what was decided about each, A-numbered.
The raw entries are in [`findings.md`](findings.md); this file holds the items. Each item
names where it goes: **upstream** (an issue or PR at `coffeenmusic/altium-mcp`), **local**
(a fix on `ad25`, sent upstream as a PR when it is general), **usage** (a note for the
sessions that use the server), or **not taken**.

Three sections: **Open**, not yet fixed; **Waiting**, fixed and not yet settled (a PR not
merged, a fix not yet run in a session); **Closed**, merged upstream, run and held, or
decided against, with the record.

**Open: A1.**

## Open

**A1. `get_server_status` reports no version or commit.** It returns the Altium exe and the
script path only, so a result cannot be tied to the code that ran. Until fixed, the release
folder in `script_path` names the stamp, and its `BUILD.txt` the commit (`CLAUDE.md`,
*Release and run*). Local: add the `manifest.json` version and the content of `BUILD.txt`
when present; upstream PR for the version part.

## Waiting

## Closed
